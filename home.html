						<p>Before beginning to buil web applications as part of the course work for COSC 630, it was very important to understand the tradeoffs involved in choosing the technology stack for a project. In the short term I had to use the framework, if I were to complete a web application project, I had to rely heavily on the documentation that was available on the web and user community. Choice of data source is another important decision. I made a conscious choice of working with different data sources in my projects so I understand them better. MySQl, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, SQLite and finally just json files as data source. I learnt a thing or two usig each of these data sources.

						<p> Most of the development work (but for the ASP .NET application) was done on a ubuntu Amazon EC2 instance. I explored many choices for deploying the applications on productions. Some of the things I was looking for from the hosting service provider was support for multiple platforms, so I could deply all my projects on the same provider's cloud. Cost was a criteria too. Other criteria was the degree of control the hosting cloud provided to me in monitoring the logs, installing the modules I need and so forth. I elected to deploy my projects on heroku. </p>
